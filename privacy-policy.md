### Privacy Policy for Sepolia Etherscan Fields Rename Extension

Last updated: [26 - October - 2024]
<br><br>
This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled by the Ethereum Address Customizer extension (the “Extension”). This Extension respects your privacy, and we are committed to protecting your data while using the Extension.

1. Information Collection and Use
   The Extension does not collect, transmit, or process any personally identifiable information, health data, payment data, authentication details, or any sensitive user data.

2. Local Storage of Custom Names
   The Extension allows users to assign custom names to Ethereum addresses to improve readability on Etherscan. These custom names are stored locally using Chrome’s synchronized storage, meaning they are only accessible on your device and are not transmitted to any external servers or third parties. This storage is necessary to retain your settings and customizations across browser sessions.

3. Permissions and Data Use
   The Extension requires the following permissions solely to provide its core functionality:

   Storage: To save and retrieve custom names for Ethereum addresses, allowing your customizations to persist across sessions.
   Context Menus: To provide a convenient option for users to assign custom names by right-clicking on an address.
   Scripting: To inject custom names on Etherscan pages by replacing Ethereum addresses with user-defined names.
   Host (Etherscan): To apply the address name customizations only when browsing Etherscan pages, where the Extension is intended to work. 4. Data Sharing and Transfers
   The Extension does not share, transfer, or sell any data to third parties. All data generated or modified by the Extension is stored locally on your device.

4. Data Retention
   The Extension retains user-defined custom names for addresses only in local storage on your browser. You can delete all stored custom names by using the reset option within the Extension or by uninstalling it from your browser.

5. Security
   We prioritize protecting the integrity of any data stored on your device. However, please note that no system can be completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security of your data.

6. Changes to this Privacy Policy
   We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any updates.

7. Contact Us
